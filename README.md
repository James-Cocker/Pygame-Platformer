# My Project

A Pygame Platformer names Rage Dungeon, whereby the player is able to progress through levels, collect items
and upgrade their skillset to progress further. There are mobs and weapon upgrades for the player to choose
from. The layout of levels is as followed; there are 9 levels, where each 3 the player will aquire a new 
upgrade, and the game will become significantly harder. The mobs in each level will increase in difficulty. 
The balance of increasing mob difficulty and giving the player upgrades will keep the game interesting when playing.
Please see the writeup for an insight as to how I designed the game, overcoming challenges, testing and reviewing
