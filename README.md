# My Project

A Pygame Platformer under the name 'Rage Dungeon' whereby the player will progress through levels, collect items
and upgrade their skillset to progress further. There will be mobs and weapon upgrades for the player to choose
from. The layout of levels is as followed; there will be threee chapters, each with a distinct biome, in which will
contain a further 3 levels. The mobs in each level will increase in difficulty, however there will be a balance of
upgrades and abilities to help the player.
